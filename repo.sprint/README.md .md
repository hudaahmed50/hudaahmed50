2- Explain each method ..
            * iterweekdays() method	Return an iterator for the weekdays numbers that will be used for one week
            * Exceptions: The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
                        The except block lets you handle the error.
                        The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- 
            * Regex: Python has a built-in package called `re`, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.Import the `re` module: import re
            * Classes:  Methods with a double underscore before and after their name are considered as built-in methods. They are used by       interpreters and are generally used in the implementation of overloaded operators or other built-in functionality.    
            * Zipped!:function returns a zip object, which is an iterator of tuples where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together etc. If the passed iterators have different lengths, the iterator with the least items decides the length of the new iterator.
                   Syntax    zip(*iterator1, iterator2, iterator3 ..)*
